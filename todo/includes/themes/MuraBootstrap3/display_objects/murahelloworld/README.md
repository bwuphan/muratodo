# murahelloworld

This is an example 'hello world' display object for [Mura CMS](http://www.getmura.com) v7.

## Please Note
This is intended for Mura CMS (v7+) training purposes only. It should **not** be used for production purposes.

This is the CFML branch of the [murahelloworld project](https://github.com/stevewithington/murahelloworld/tree/cfml). It is intended to be an example of how a ColdFusion/CFML developer might approach creating an ultra-simple display object.

Also see [http://www.getmura.com/blog/mura-cms-7-new-display-object-conventions/](http://www.getmura.com/blog/mura-cms-7-new-display-object-conventions/) for more details about display objects in Mura 7.

## Instructions
Each branch of [this project](https://github.com/stevewithington/murahelloworld) is intended to be an example of how to create an ultra-simple display object.

Switch to the desired branch, download it, and place entire directory under the theme's `display_objects` directory. For example: `{SiteID}/includes/themes/{ThemeName}/display_objects/murahelloworld`

Reload Mura CMS and a new display object option should appear in the list of available display objects when using **Inline Edit** mode. Simply drag it onto the layout in the desired region and publish.
